  - text: "Data is the information economy’s fuel; like solar energy, it is a renewable resource that can benefit everyone at once without being diminished. Companies want to harvest as much data about people as possible to target them for advertisements, track high-traffic areas in stores or show us more cat videos to keep us on their site longer. Data provides a record of what has already happened, but its main value comes from improved decision-making and predictive capabilities. Major companies choose products and prices based on what you, and others like you, bought in the past. Your data improves their decision-making, boosting corporate profits. By transforming quantitative data into qualitative insights, data analytics professionals shape organizational strategies and impact the bottom line. They also contribute to the greater social good, using data to address pressing challenges in health care, housing, poverty, education and transportation.
          In the Katz School’s M.S. in Data Analytics and Visualization, you’ll learn to transform raw data into insightful output. You’ll master the underlying science of predictive and exploratory analyses as well as techniques for creating visualizations and data narratives. You’ll master in-demand tools like Python, SQL/NoSQL, Tableau, AWS and AutoML. And unlike other data analytics programs, you’ll experiment with basic AI and machine-learning techniques. Learn from world-class professionals and get real-world predictive and analytical skills in the heart of New York City. Generous scholarships and financial aid are available."

Our master's program takes a multidisciplinary approach to diagnosing and treating speech, language, swallowing and communication cases across the lifespan. With three options to pursue your studies—full-time on-campus, full-time online or part-time online—you can choose the program that fits your schedule.
          While at YU, students participate in four clinical externships, learn how to conduct telehealth sessions and gain clinical experience under the guidance of faculty, supervisors and mentors. Within the coursework, students utilize technology, such as endoscopy, electrical stimulation and ultrasound, to assist with the diagnosis of voice, speech and swallowing disorders. They also obtain the necessary counseling skills to support families facing a challenging diagnosis. In addition, students have the opportunity to attend professional conferences, contribute to scholarly publications and integrate evidence-based practice into clinical practice.
          At Yeshiva, we’re experts in the medical aspects of speech pathology, and each of us teaches to our own specialty. That’s truly unheard of. ~ Dr. Marissa Barrera, Program Director and Assistant Dean of Health Sciences
          The program is ideal for ambitious and passionate individuals with a background in communication sciences. Upon graduation, students will be prepared to apply for state licensure, SLP doctoral programs and certification from the American Speech-Language Hearing Association (ASHA).
          SLP graduates enter the workforce as health care practitioners who are trained and dedicated to the preservation and prolongation of life, including improving the quality of life, health and wellness for people of all ages.
          Speech-language pathology salaries range from $66,000 to $100,000 based on experience, according to a 2019 ASHA annual salary report. There's no better time to pursue a career in SLP as jobs in the field are expected to grow 25 percent until 2029, much faster than the average for all occupations, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics."
