Ran Drori
ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF CHEMISTRY AND BIOCHEMISTRY

BIOGRAPHY:
I found the interaction between ice and antifreeze proteins a fascinating subject, and decided to pursue my Ph.D while studying these proteins with Prof. Ido Braslavsky at the Hebrew University (Rehovot campus). I started my post-doc at NYU's Chemistry department on October 2014, working with Profs. Michael Ward and Bart Kahr on two projects - (1) identifying synthetic ice growth inhibitors and (2) studying how does the exchange between H2O and D2O affect ice growth dynamics.

On August 2017, I joined the Chemistry and Biochemistry Department at Yeshiva University as a visiting assistant professor.
