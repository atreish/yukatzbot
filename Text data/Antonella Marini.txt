Antonella Marini
PROFESSOR, DEPARTMENT OF MATHEMATICS AT YESHIVA COLLEGE

EDUCATION:
PhD in Mathematics, University of Chicago
MS in Mathematics, University of Chicago
Laurea in Matematica, University of Rome 1 "La Sapienza"
BIOGRAPHY:
Antonella Marini was born in Italy. She did her graduate studies in Mathematics at the University of Chicago, specializing in boundary value problems in gauge theories. She has worked at the Courant Institute of NYU as a Postdoctoral Fellow, at the University of Utah as a full time Instructor, at the University of L'Aquila as a tenured Researcher and as a tenured Associate Professor.

TEACHING AND RESEARCH INTERESTS:
Her research involves the areas of Geometric Analysis, Partial Differential Equations and Mathematical Physics. More specifically, it focuses on nonlinear partial differential equations and boundary value problems arising in gauge theories, such as Yang-Mills and Yang-Mills-Higgs theory, bosonic field theories and nonlinear Hodge and Hodge-Frobenius Theory. Other research interests include the Calculus of Variations, harmonic maps, Ginzburg Landau vortices, quantum field theories (related to her work on gauge theories); elliptic--hyperbolic equations and applications (related to her work on the Hodge-Frobenius equations). Her teaching interests include Ordinary and Partial Differential Equations with applications to modeling in environmental and biological sciences, Calculus and Advanced Calculus, Topology, Linear Algebra, Abstract Algebra, Real and Complex Variables, Functional Analysis, Geometric Analysis, Morse Theory, Differential Geometry and Lie Groups.

HONORS AND AWARDS:
