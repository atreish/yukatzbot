Occupational Therapy Doctorate program:

Occupational therapists help people of all ages manage the daily activities, or occupations, they need and want to do; prevent or live better with illness, injury and disability; and promote personal health and well-being.
The Katz School’s entry-level Occupational Therapy Doctorate, the first fully accredited entry-level OT doctoral program in the New York metropolitan area, trains caring and competent scholar-practitioners to develop and deliver holistic services through the integration of theory, research and knowledge-based practice and clinical skills.
As one of these scholar-practitioners, you will be a lifelong learner, as well as a leader and an advocate for the profession in diverse local and global communities. In state-of-the-art laboratories, nationally and internationally renowned faculty will assist you in applying the knowledge that you've acquired toward building the critical skills that will enable you to promote health, well-being and resilience through occupational engagement.
Demand for qualified occupational therapists continues to increase. With YU’s hands-on, entry-level Occupational Therapy Doctorate, you’ll graduate in under three years with the expertise to help clients gain greater independence and confidence in performing the tasks of everyday living. Occupational therapy is ranked in the top 20 in U.S. News & World Report's Top Health Care Jobs. For more information about occupational therapy, visit the American Occupational Therapy Association website here.
