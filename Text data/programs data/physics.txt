Physics program:

YU’s M.A. in Physics specializes in solving problems in classical and quantum information, mechanical, optical and electronic materials behavior, propagation of waves, biological matter, dynamics, statistical thermodynamics, and hardware and software development. These activities are of intrinsic interest from a fundamental point of view, and they are also geared toward applied physics and engineering.
Our master's in physics explores the fields of foundational and applied physics. It prepares students for careers in academia, industry, teaching, finance and entrepreneurship while also developing an artistic appreciation for observing nature from a physicist’s perspective. With robust knowledge of computer software and hardware development, our graduates secure rewarding jobs in the high-technology field, including developing their own high-tech startups. They also continue on to Ph.D. programs and apply their knowledge in a range of industries, such as engineering, business, finance and medicine. Come to New York City to study and network with the best. Generous scholarships and financial aid are currently available.
