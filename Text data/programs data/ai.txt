Artificial Intelligence program:

In this interdisciplinary master’s degree program, you’ll design and build cutting-edge artificial intelligence technologies for a variety of applications, including finance, biotech, cybersecurity, ad-tech and health care. Working with top researchers and accomplished industry experts, you’ll bridge AI and machine learning models, such as supervised and unsupervised learning, deep learning and neural networks, and reinforcement learning with engineering best practices including problem framing, requirements gathering, UI/UX and software development. In addition, you’ll gain hands-on experience with structured and unstructured data using the latest tools, such as Python, R, SQL/NoSQL, TensorFlow, Keras and pyTorch. And you’ll be doing all of this in the heart of New York City.
The New York metropolitan area has the highest number of AI-related jobs in the country. As a graduate of Yeshiva University’s master’s degree in artificial intelligence, you’ll be prepared for a variety of artificial-intelligence and machine-learning jobs in research and development groups, product design labs, innovative startups and Ph.D. programs. In its Future of Jobs Report 2020, the World Economic Forum ranked AI and machine learning specialists second among the top 20 jobs increasing in demand in all industries. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on the salaries of the following jobs in 2019: AI engineer ($92,000 to $140,000); data mining and analysis ($100,000 to $220,000); machine learning engineer ($146,000); data scientist ($86,000 to $157,000); and business intelligence developer ($84,000 to $104,000).
