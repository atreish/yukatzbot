Data Analytics and Visualization program:

Data is the information economy’s fuel; like solar energy, it is a renewable resource that can benefit everyone at once without being diminished. Companies want to harvest as much data about people as possible to target them for advertisements, track high-traffic areas in stores or show us more cat videos to keep us on their site longer. Data provides a record of what has already happened, but its main value comes from improved decision-making and predictive capabilities. Major companies choose products and prices based on what you, and others like you, bought in the past. Your data improves their decision-making, boosting corporate profits. By transforming quantitative data into qualitative insights, data analytics professionals shape organizational strategies and impact the bottom line. They also contribute to the greater social good, using data to address pressing challenges in health care, housing, poverty, education and transportation.
In the Katz School’s M.S. in Data Analytics and Visualization, you’ll learn to transform raw data into insightful output. You’ll master the underlying science of predictive and exploratory analyses as well as techniques for creating visualizations and data narratives. You’ll master in-demand tools like Python, SQL/NoSQL, Tableau, AWS and AutoML. And unlike other data analytics programs, you’ll experiment with basic AI and machine-learning techniques. Learn from world-class professionals and get real-world predictive and analytical skills in the heart of New York City. Generous scholarships and financial aid are available.
