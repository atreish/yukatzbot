M.A. in Mathematics program:

In the M.A. in Mathematics, students gain a solid foundation in advanced mathematics and develop skills in mathematical modeling, numerical applications and data analysis in order to succeed in a variety of professions. A master's degree in mathematics opens many doors to jobs in finance, technology, biomedicine and data analysis, among others. The master’s program also provides an excellent foundation for our Ph.D. program.
Jobs in math occupations are expected to grow 27 percent through 2029, much faster than the average for all occupations, and will add about 56,100 jobs, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. This growth is based on the expectation that businesses and government agencies will continue emphasizing the use of big data. Math salaries were on average $90,410 in 2019. Generous scholarships and financial aid are available for a limited time. Come to New York City to study and network with the best.
