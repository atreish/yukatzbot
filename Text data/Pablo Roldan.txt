TEACHING AND RESEARCH INTERESTS:
My research is in the area of Differential Equations and Dynamical Systems, more specifically Hamiltonian systems. The approach is both rigorous and numeric, with special attention to applications. I like writting my own software: special-purpose numerical algorithms for dynamical systems, and in some cases High-Performance Computing programs that are executed in dedicated computer clusters. Besides Mathematics I also have a strong interest in Finance. Sporadically I collaborate with software companies as external scientific consultant for problems involving HPC, Big Data, and Statistics.
